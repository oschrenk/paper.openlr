\begin{abstract}
Open LR\tm\footnote{Open LR\tm is a trade mark of TomTom International B.V} - is a proposed standard for encoding, transmitting and decoding location references. The protocol employs a shortest path algorithm in order to reduce the number of nodes needed to encode a location into a location reference. This article shows that Open LR\tm can produce wrong results and describes the differences between two maps that bear these problems.
